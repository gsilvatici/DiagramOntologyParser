# DiagramOntologyParser

This program takes a Camunda BPM diagram and translates it to a ontology.

## Usage

Run the .jar file, the program will display a button to select a camunda bpm file to translate ta a ontology,
the translated ontologies will be displayed on the "generated ontologies" section in the middle of the screen.

## Considerations

The goal of the software is to generate ontologies (owl files) from bpm files, so for reasoning and querying the generated ontologies
it must make use of utilities like Protégé.
